# DiscreteLogicSimulator [WIP]

C++ project simulating behaviour of discrete gates.  
User can instantiate gates, connect them with one another and interface with created circuit via input gates.

The project is written fully in C++ using object oriented programming and some of the standard library functionalities. It uses SFML library for graphics handling.  

#### Done:
1. Generic logic backend.  
2. Class hierarchy for all of the gate types.
3. Input gate, output gate, NAND gate.
4. Custom gates (composite of multiple NAND gates).
5. Managing connections and graphics.
#### TODO:
1. Saving and reading custom gates from file.
2. Clock node.
3. UI interface.
